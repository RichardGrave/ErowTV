## Bugs ##
- [x] Fix bug with COPY/DESTROY FROM and TO blocks. Sometimes they only COPY/DESTROY a small part between the blocks.

## Changes ##
- [ ] I want to remmove the Special sign so that every sign can be use for special actions.\
At first I used it so players can't click other players signs with the memory system. But for the mini-games everybody must have the ability to click the sign. I don't see any reason to block other players for clicking Timer, YouTube or paste signs either.


## New features ##
- [ ] Copy chest contents when using the Copy/Paste function
- [ ] A server memory system, that remembers where the placed signs (with special actions) are in the world that need to be loaded at startup. For example the YouTube subscribers counter.
- [ ] Mini-games: Atleast one (to start with)
- [ ] Turn lights on/off with special buttons that connect to a light source through coordinates. (also needs system memory)
- [ ] A bridge builder to get over water or canyons.
- [ ] Maybe a Twitter Subscribers Counter
- [ ] A chest with books that explain how to use all the features (and games).
- [ ] Extra commands usable in the chat (Maybe block building rows/heigth etc. + show list files from COPY)
- [ ] A stair builder to get down from a high place or to go up.
- [ ] Picture builder. Read image file and use colored blocks to build the picture in Minecraft.
